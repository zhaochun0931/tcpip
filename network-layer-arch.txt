The process of sending and receiving data over a network is commonly categorized into 7 layers. The layers are typically abbreviated as L1 - L7. You can think of data as passing through each of these layers in turn as it is sent or received from an application, with each layer being responsible for a particular part of the processing required to send or receive the data over the network.



In a modern enterprise or public cloud network, the layers commonly map as follows:
L5-7: all the protocols most application developers are familiar with. e.g. HTTP, FTP, SSH, SSL, DNS.
L4: TCP or UDP, including source and destination ports.
L3: IP packets and IP routing.
L2: Ethernet packets and Ethernet switching.
